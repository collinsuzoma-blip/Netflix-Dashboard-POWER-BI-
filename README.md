# Netflix Content Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard built to explore Netflix’s content library.  
The focus of this project is **clear insights, clean layout, and recruiter-friendly storytelling**, rather than over-designed visuals.

The dataset is embedded directly in the Power BI file, so the report opens and works immediately without external connections.

---

## Project Overview

The dashboard answers simple but practical questions:

- How has Netflix content grown over time?
- What types of content dominate the platform?
- Which countries contribute the most titles?
- How can individual titles be explored in detail?

The report is split into two pages to support both **high-level analysis** and **title-level exploration**.

## Report Pages

### 1. Overview
This page provides a summary view of the Netflix catalog:
- Content trend over time using the *Date Added* hierarchy
- Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
- Category and genre breakdown
- Geographic distribution of titles by country

This page is designed for quick insights and executive-style review.

### 2. Single Title View
This page allows deeper exploration:
- Filter by title using slicers
- View detailed metadata (type, rating, year added)
- See country-level availability and supporting visuals

This view demonstrates drill-down analysis and interactive reporting.

## Data Structure

The Power BI model includes multiple related tables, representing a realistic catalog-style dataset:

- Titles (main fact table)
- Categories / genres
- Countries released
- Directors
- Cast
- Descriptions

All relationships are modeled inside Power BI to support filtering and cross-highlighting.
